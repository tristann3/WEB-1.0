Each challenge file has some starter code and comments with directions. The solution files show a possible solution. Open the solution to see the expected end reults. 

Then open the challenge code in the browser and in your editor. Follow the instructions in the comments and refresh the browser as you work so you see your progress. 

It's important to see the effect of each new style rule as it is applied. This will give you a better understanding of what those rules are doing and how the properties interact. 

**Pro tip:** Install Live Server in your code editor. This will open your html page in the browser and refresh automatically as you save your files.
